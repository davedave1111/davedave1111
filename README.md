Hey There! My name is David or my handle @davedave1111
I'm a student studying Computer Science and Engineering, and Electrical Engineering! I'm interested in the developement of physical 
devices, both from an electrical engineering standpoint as well as a software engineering standpoint. I'm currently working on broadening my horizons 
when it comes to my programming, and incorperating some concepts that I'm less comfortable with to learn new things! A lot of my personal projects revolve around 
microcontrollers and embedded devices (A lot of RPI and Arduino, although I'm looking to explore alternatives to the former ATM due to the shortage of raspberry 
devices).
